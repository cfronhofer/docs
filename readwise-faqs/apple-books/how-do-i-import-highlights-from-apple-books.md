# How do I import highlights from Apple Books?

It's much harder to import your highlights from Apple Books (iBooks) than it is from other e-reading platforms such as Amazon Kindle, but that's okay. There are still two ways to get your Apple Books highlights into Readwise.

First, you can download and install the Readwise Mac tool on your computer by following the instructions here: [Readwise Mac Tool](https://readwise.io/ibooks).

Second, you can email highlights to Readwise directly from the Books app on your iPhone or iPad by following the instructions here: [How do I import Apple Books highlights from my iPhone/iPad?](https://help.readwise.io/article/35-how-do-i-import-apple-books-highlights-from-my-iphoneipad)
