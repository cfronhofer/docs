# How does the Readwise to Logseq export integration work?

To begin exporting your Readwise highlights to Logseq, you first need to install the Readwise Official plugin from within your Logseq application:

1. Click into the "..." menu within Logseq (typically in the top right corner)
2. Select Plugins
3. Click Marketplace and search for "Readwise Official" (note that there are a few other Readwise plugins, so be sure to choose the official version)
4. Click Install
5. Back out of the plugins screen to return to Logseq
6. In the top right you should now see a Readwise logo
7. Click the logo and finish the configuration from there

We recommend testing the export in a sandboxed graph until you get the settings dialed into your preferences. Then you can export into your main graph.

## What happens when I take new highlights? Will those automatically sync with Logseq?

Yes! You can configure the Readwise Logseq plugin to automatically sync any new highlights that come into Readwise. If the highlight is from a _new_ book, article, or Twitter account, a new page in the Logseq graph will be made. If the highlight is from an _existing_ book, article, or Twitter account, the highlight will be _appended_ to the bottom of the existing page. Because the Readwise plugin is append-only, nothing in Logseq will ever be overwritten.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Certain services such as Amazon Kindle, Instapaper, and Pocket only synchronize with Readwise a few times a day. For this reason, the highlight may not immediately appear in either Readwise or Logseq. If you need to sync sooner, you should first force a manual resync in Readwise of the highlight source and then initiate a sync in Logseq from either the Readwise plugin screen.
{% endhint %}

## How do I trigger a new sync from within Logseq?

You can set the Readwise plugin to automatically sync whenever you open the Logseq app. If syncing is set to manual, you can trigger a new sync by opening the plugin menu and clicking "Initiate Sync."

## What happens when I update highlights in Readwise? Will those changes automatically sync with Logseq? (Or vice versa?)

At the moment, no.

## Can I rename the file of a book, article, or Twitter page in Logseq?

If you rename a file that was generated by the Readwise plugin, the plugin will create a new file with that name on the next export. This means it's fine to rename files for books and articles where you do not expect to take any more highlights, but if you're continuing to take highlights in the document, you will end up with two files.

## Can I move either the Readwise folder or individual pages to another location in my Logseq graph?

Similar to the answer above, if you move a file that was generated by the Readwise plugin, the plugin will create a new file in the original location if you took new highlights. This means it's fine to move files for books and articles where you do not expect to take any more highlights, but if you're continuing to take highlights in the document, you will end up with two files.

## Can I edit the text of a book, article, or Twitter page in Logseq?

Yes! You can edit the text of a page as you wish and the Readwise integration will not overwrite any changes you make. New highlights will be appended to the bottom of the page.

## How do I reset the export of my whole library or an individual document to start fresh?

You can easily reset the Readwise export to start fresh by opening the Readwise plugin menu and clicking the red Reset button at the very bottom.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** This will delete all the pages previously created by the plugin, so only use this option if you are certain you do not need any notes you may have taken.
{% endhint %}

## Can I customize the default how my notes are formatted in Logseq?

Absolutely! See [How can I customize the Readwise to Logseq Export?](https://help.readwise.io/article/139-how-can-i-customize-the-readwise-to-logseq-export) for how to customize the note's title, metadata, headers, highlights, and sync notifications.

## Where does the Location link after each Kindle highlight take me?

If you have the Kindle app installed on your desktop, clicking the Location link will launch the Kindle app and jump you to the highlight in the book.
