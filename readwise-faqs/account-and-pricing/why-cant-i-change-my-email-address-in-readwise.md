# Why can't I change my email address in Readwise?

If you're trying to change your email address on the [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) page and the new address isn't saving, it probably means that the email address you inputted is already in use. In other words, you've already created another account using the new email address.

If this is the case, here are the steps to fix the duplicate account:

1. Logout of Readwise under the current email address ([logout](http://readwise.io/logout))
2. Log back in to Readwise using the new email address
3. Delete the account ([delete](https://readwise.io/delete))
4. Log back in to Readwise using the original email address
5. Change the login address of the original account on the [Preferences](https://readwise.io/preferences) page
