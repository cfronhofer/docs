# Does Readwise offer an academic discount?

Yes! We offer a 50% discount to students and other members of academia and those in education. All subscriptions (Lite, Full, annual, monthly) are able to receive the discount.

{% hint style="warning" %}
At this time, discounts can only be applied to subscriptions placed on the Readwise website. **We are unable to apply discounts through Apple for subscriptions made through the iOS app.** Apologies for any inconvenience.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### If you're in your free trial period

To take advantage of the discount while you are in trial, create an account and then email us at [hello@readwise.io](mailto:hello@readwise.io) with proof of your academic status (a photo of your ID or an email address works fine). We'll apply the student discount to your account so your pricing options will be updated to reflect the discount here: [https://readwise.io/pricing](https://readwise.io/pricing).

### If you're subscribed <a href="#if-youre-subscribed-zoaiw" id="if-youre-subscribed-zoaiw"></a>

If you've already subscribed to Readwise, simply email us at [hello@readwise.io](mailto:hello@readwise.io) with proof of your academic status (a photo of your ID or an email address works fine). We'll then apply the 50% discount by issuing a partial refund and make sure the discount is applied going forward.
