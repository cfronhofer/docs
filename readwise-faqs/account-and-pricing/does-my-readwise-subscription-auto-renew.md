# Does my Readwise subscription auto-renew?

Your Readwise subscription will auto-renew based on your billing cycle (monthly or annually). If you have an annual subscription, we will always send a reminder email a week before the plan renews to make sure you have an opportunity to discontinue service, if you wish.

If you'd like to change your subscription to not auto-renew, please reach out to the team at [hello@readwise.com](mailto:hello@readwise.io). We can set up your account with manual billing, meaning you'll receive an invoice via email on your next billing date and you can choose to renew or not. Your card will then only be charged if you choose to renew your subscription.
