# Why does my invoice include tax charges?

{% hint style="warning" %}
Taxes are first being rolled out to new users as we make the needed updates to our payment processing system. If you subscribed prior to October 30, 2023, you won't see taxes appear on your invoice yet (and, depending on your [location](https://help.readwise.io/article/161-tax-faq#Where-is-Readwise-required-to-collect-taxes-kpQaT), you may never see this change at all).

## Why does my charge now include sales tax, VAT, etc? <a href="#why-does-my-charge-now-include-sales-tax-vat-etc-otj6k" id="why-does-my-charge-now-include-sales-tax-vat-etc-otj6k"></a>

Many Readwise customers are based in jurisdictions where the presiding governments mandate the collection of various taxes such as sales tax, value added tax (VAT), and others. Each location has its own rules about when a company needs to start collecting taxes, usually based on the total value of its sales or the number of its transactions per year or quarter. When a company crosses these thresholds, it has to start collecting taxes on behalf of the taxing authority. So if your charge previously excluded tax but now includes it, it means that Readwise has crossed a threshold in your geography.

Note that if you subscribed to Readwise through the Apple App Store, you should not see a change to your pricing as Apple was already collecting sales tax and VAT. This change only affects users who subscribed via the Readwise website.

## Why does Readwise collect sales tax, VAT, etc when other similar software services don’t?

It’s hard to say without investigating the specific facts and circumstance, but it’s likely these businesses should be collecting tax but either (1) don’t realize they’re required to or (2) their operations are too small to be audited or [trigger thresholds](https://help.readwise.io/article/161-tax-faq#Why-does-my-charge-now-include-sales-tax-VAT-etc-OtJ6k). In other words, they likely will collect tax at some point.

## Why are prices listed without tax?

In some countries, it's common to include taxes in the listed prices—that's called tax-inclusive pricing. In the United States, where Readwise is based, prices are listed without tax and then added on at the end. This is known as tax-exclusive pricing.

As a U.S. company, Readwise uses tax-exclusive pricing by default. Further, the website typically does not know where you are geographically located, so the pricing page is unable to determine any taxes that might be required until you provide the necessary information. Once you provide your geographical location and business status, the tax to be collected will be presented on your invoice as illustrated below.

## What happens if I update my address?

Changing your address in your [billing information](https://help.readwise.io/article/161-tax-faq#Where-can-I-update-my-billing-information-1vhbj) may change the tax rate on your future invoices. This is because tax rates are based on your [location](https://help.readwise.io/article/161-tax-faq#How-is-the-applicable-tax-determined-P7wMA). If you move from a place with a 10% tax to a 20% tax (or vice versa), your next invoice will reflect that. Just make sure to update your address before your next billing cycle to see the change.
