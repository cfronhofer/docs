# How do I invite my friends to Readwise?

While you're in your free trial period, you can use your [personal invite link](https://readwise.io/invite) to get both you and your friend an extra free month of Readwise!

Right now, the invite bonus only adds free months for those users in trial. That said, your friends will still get the free months even if you use the invite link after you've subscribed.
