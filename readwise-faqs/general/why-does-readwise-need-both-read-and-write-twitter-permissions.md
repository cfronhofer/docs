# Why does Readwise need both read and write Twitter permissions?

Protecting the privacy of our users is important to us, but unfortunately Twitter's current API provides only three permission levels for developers:

It's our understanding that Twitter is in the process of developing a new version of their public API which will allow for much finer grained control of permissions. Whenever that happens, we will adjust our integration accordingly. Until then, this is the only way to enable our users to share Tweets to their own timelines as well as save Tweets to their Readwise accounts.

However, as an important note: we will **never** tweet anything without your permission, and do not read any data but your tweets to @readwiseio.
