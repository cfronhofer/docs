# How do I prevent Twitter thread duplicates in Readwise and Reader?

By default, individual Twitter posts will be saved as a highlight to your Readwise account, while Twitter threads will be saved to Reader as an article.

If your threads or single tweets are appearing in both places, itâ€™s possible that your Twitter settings are causing an overlap.

To adjust this, click into your Account Settings in Reader and select Integrations. Click the Settings button to expand the options (see screenshot below). To reduce duplicates, make sure that each type is only checked on for either Reader or Readwise, rather than both.
