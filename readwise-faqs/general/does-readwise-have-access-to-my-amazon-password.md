# Does Readwise have access to my Amazon password?

No! In fact, Readwise couldn't access your Amazon password even if we wanted it to.

* When you sign in using Amazon's authentication, Readwise only receives your email address.
* When you sync your highlights with the Readwise browser extension, Readwise only has access to the subdomain read.amazon.com â€” which _never_ exposes your Amazon password; only your books and highlights.
