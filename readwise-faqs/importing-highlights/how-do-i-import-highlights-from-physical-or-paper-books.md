# How do I import highlights from physical or paper books?

If you have the Readwise [iOS app](https://readwise.app.link/6VY4GcGnIgb) or [Android app](https://readwise.app.link/jRPHsdEnIgb) installed, you can capture highlights from paper books using your phone's camera and optical character recognition (OCR).&#x20;

You can also use screenshots or other photos already stored in your phone's camera roll by selecting the photo gallery option in the bottom right-hand corner.

In addition to OCR, you can manually type up highlights into Readwise from the [dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) > [Import](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync) > [Freeform Input](https://readwise.io/import\_freeform).&#x20;

Finally, you can add the titles of paper books you've read and audiobooks you've listened to as [Supplemental Books](https://readwise.io/quick) to see popular highlights in your Daily Review.
