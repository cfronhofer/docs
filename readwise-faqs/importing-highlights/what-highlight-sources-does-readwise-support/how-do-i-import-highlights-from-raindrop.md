# How do I import highlights from Raindrop?

You can import your [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) highlights to Readwise with our native integration.&#x20;

## Getting Started

1\. Head to the Readwise import page and select the [Raindrop option](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync#raindrop).&#x20;

2\. Connect to Raindrop.&#x20;

3\. Watch your Raindrop highlights automatically sync to reader, including tags and annotations:

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of right now, this integration only imports text-based highlights, not images.
{% endhint %}

## Re-syncing Highlights

Your Raindrop highlights should sync periodically throughout the day. If you ever want to instantly re-sync to import new highlights, head to the [import page](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync), locate Raindrop, and click "Sync Now."
