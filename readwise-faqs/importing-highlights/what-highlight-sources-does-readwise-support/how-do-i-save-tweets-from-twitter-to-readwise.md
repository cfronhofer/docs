# How do I save Tweets from Twitter to Readwise?

You can start saving Tweets and Twitter threads to Readwise by connecting your Twitter account to Readwise from the [dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) > [Import](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync) > [Twitter](https://readwise.io/twitter\_start).

Once connected, you can save an individual tweet by replying with **@readwise save** as shown below:

If another user has already saved the tweet via **@readwise**, then you can simply like the **@readwise save** reply to save it directly into your library. Example shown below:

Or you can send Tweets to **@readwise** via DM. If you DM the Tweet, any text you include in the message will be treated as a note in Readwise. (Great for [inline tagging](https://blog.readwise.io/tag-your-highlights-while-you-read/)!)

You can save entire Twitter threads by replying with **@readwise save thread** as shown below:

If another user has already saved the thread via **@readwise**, then you can simply like the Readwise reply to save it directly into your library. Example shown below:

You can also DM the thread to **@readwise** with the word **thread** or **t** in the message. Any text you include in the message will be treated as a note in Readwise.

If your Twitter account is set to private, please message us at [hello@readwise.io](mailto:hello@readwise.io) to follow you on Twitter so that we can see the tweets/threads you save and import them into your library for you.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can still tag "[@readwiseio](https://twitter.com/Readwiseio) save" in your Tweets if you want, or you can use [@readwise](https://twitter.com/readwise) and save yourself 2 charactersâ€”both work :)
