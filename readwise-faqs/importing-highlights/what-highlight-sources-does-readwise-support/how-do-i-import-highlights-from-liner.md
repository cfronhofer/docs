Liner doesn't offer a public API, so there's no way to build an automatic integration with their service. That said, there is a manual method to import your Liner highlights into Readwise. Here are the steps:

1. In Liner, select the articles to export highlights from by clicking the check mark circle in the upper right corner of each article.
2.  Select Export in the right-panel and choose Email as shown below:

3. Send the export to add@readwise.io.&#x20;

The highlights will be automatically imported into your Readwise account.

Note that you can alternatively highlight and right-click on any webpage in Chrome to quickly clip specific passages to Readwise as shown below:
