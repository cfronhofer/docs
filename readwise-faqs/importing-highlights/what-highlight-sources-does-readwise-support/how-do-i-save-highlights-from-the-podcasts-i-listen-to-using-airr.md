# How do I save highlights from the podcasts I listen to using Airr?

{% hint style="danger" %}
We used to support Airr, but the app has been removed from the App Store. If you're looking for another podcast app that integrates with Readwise, check out Snipd: [How do I import highlights from Snipd?](https://help.readwise.io/article/131-how-do-i-import-highlights-from-snipd)

[Airr](http://airr.io/) is a podcast app which makes it easy to save quotes from a podcast _as you're listening to it_.

We've teamed up with Airr to allow you to save the best snippets from your podcasts directly (and automatically) into Readwise!

## Set Up

1. Download the [Airr app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/airr-share-podcast-clips/id1355926315?ls=1) (iOS only... for now!)
2. Select the **Library icon** in bottom tray > **Settings icon** on the top right corner > **Readwise** > copy/paste your Readwise access token into Airr as described in the app:

That's it! Now, whenever you take an AirrQuote in the Airr app, you'll automatically have that snippet (with a link to play the audio in Airr, your caption, and a transcript of the quote if available) saved to Readwise... here's what it looks like:
