# How do I import highlights from Moon+ Reader?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Android's most downloaded e-reading app includes a native highlight integration with Readwise. Highlights from ebooks read in Moon+ will automatically sync to Readwise!&#x20;

## Configuration

1. Open a book > Tap the middle of the screen to open the menu tray&#x20;
2. Select **3 dots** > Check box next to **Bookmarks** > Tap **bookmark icon**&#x20;
3. Select **Settings** icon > Check box next to **Share new highlights and notes to Readwise automatically**
4. Select **Settings** icon next to the above > Select **information icon** > **Get Access Token** > copy token and paste into Moon+

## Notes

1. This is a global setting, so you won't have to complete these steps for every book.
2. Unfortunately, existing highlights won't sync, but you can delete/re-highlight your highlights to get them into Readwise.&#x20;
3. Any notes you make will need to be added first if you'd like them to import into Readwise. Otherwise, you can always edit the highlights in Readwise at a later time to add your notes.
4. If you receive an error message, it's likely because you're offline. Make sure you're connected to data or WiFi > select bookmarks in the bottom right-hand corner > tap the 3 dots next to the date and time in upper left-hand corner > Share â†’ Readwise
