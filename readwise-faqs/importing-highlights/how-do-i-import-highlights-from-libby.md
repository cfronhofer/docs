# How do I import highlights from Libby?

## **Via Kindle**

If you read and highlight your Libby books on a Kindle device or in the Kindle app, the highlights will be automatically synchronized with Readwise as long as you have the Kindle integration configured. Here are the instructions on how to [Read with Kindle](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6017.htm) while using the Libby app.

All notes and highlights are preserved in your Kindle account after a library book loan ends. You can find your library book highlights that you've read with your Kindle device or in the Kindle app here: [https://read.amazon.com/notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook). (It's also best practice to make sure your highlights and notes are uploaded to Amazon prior to your library loan expiring.)

## **Via Libby**

If you read and highlight your Libby books in the Libby app, [use this link](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync#libby) and follow the instructions on the screen. If the link isn't working for you, go to the [dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard) > [Import](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync) > **Libby**.&#x20;
