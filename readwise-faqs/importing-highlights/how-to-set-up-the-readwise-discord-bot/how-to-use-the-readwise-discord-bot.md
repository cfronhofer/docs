# How to use the Readwise Discord Bot

The [Readwise Discord bot](http://readwise.gg/) enables server members to easily save messages‚Äîincluding links, images, and even threaded conversations‚Äîto their Readwise Library for later.&#x20;

This bot also creates a sleek, auto-updating RSS feed of links shared in the server, allowing you to stay up-to-date on interesting links shared in your communities and easily jump back in to discuss. **This bot is 100% free and requires no Readwise subscription to enjoy.** &#x20;

## How to save messages inside Discord

To save a message to your private DMs for easy future reference, simply react with a bookmark emoji üîñ in a server where the Readwise bot is installed. It will automatically DM you a copy of the message for safekeeping. This is completely free.

## **How to save messages to Readwise**

You can also optionally save any message to your Readwise account by using the floppy disk emoji üíæinstead of the bookmark.

## How to add tags to saved messages

If you want to add a tag (in Readwise) to a saved message, you can reply to that message with a word beginning with a period `.` (the same as an [inline tag](https://blog.readwise.io/tag-your-highlights-while-you-read/) with any service that Readwise supports). For example, `.ai` will be turned into an AI tag.

## How to add notes to saved messages

## How to take notes with Quick Passages

## Where to find saved messages in Readwise

Once you‚Äôve connected your Readwise account, you can find your saved Discord messages in the [Tweets](https://readwise.io/tweets) section of your [Readwise Dashboard](https://readwise.io/dashboard).

## How to find your server‚Äôs custom feed aggregator

Use the slash command `/url` in any server where the Readwise bot is installed to find the link to that server's Hacker News link aggregator.

## How to find your server‚Äôs RSS feed link

Use the slash command `/rss`  in any server where the Readwise bot is installed to find the link to that server's RSS feed. When opened in a browser, this won't look like much, but if you add that RSS link to your favorite feed aggregator, you'll see your favorite Discord links come through.&#x20;
