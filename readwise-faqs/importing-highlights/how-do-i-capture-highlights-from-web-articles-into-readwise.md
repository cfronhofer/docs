# How do I capture highlights from web articles into Readwise?

There are a few ways you can capture highlights from web articles into Readwise.

## Readwise Reader (and other read-it-later apps)

You can use Readwise's own "read-it-later" app, [Reader](https://readwise.io/read), or others apps like Instapaper or Pocket that can [integrate with your Readwise account](https://readwise.io/welcome/sync). As the name would suggest, read-it-later means you save articles you come across on the internet to read later within the app. This is our recommended approach to reading and highlighting web articles because nearly all such apps (1) clean up the article to make the reading experience more enjoyable, (2) include highlighting and annotating features, and (3) automatically sync with Readwise. Reader even shares a database with Readwise, which means your highlights will sync seamlessly with no setup required!

{% hint style="info" %}
To save articles to Reader or to highlight articles on their original web pages, install the Readwise Reader browser extension:

* [Install on Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/readwise-highlighter/jjhefcfhmnkfeepcpnilbbkaadhngkbi)
* [Install on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/readwise-highlighter/)
{% endhint %}

## Save Highlight to Readwise (desktop)

If you're reading something in Chrome or Firefox with the Readwise extension installed ([Install for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readwise/egfepjgjabnppmaiadpedbgadkcelcbd)) ([Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/readwise/)), you can quickly capture a highlight to Readwise by highlighting the desired text, right-clicking, and selecting Save Highlight to Readwise. This highlight will then appear in the Articles section of your Readwise Dashboard.

## Save Highlight to Readwise (iOS) <a href="#ios" id="ios"></a>

If you're reading something in Safari with the Readwise iOS app installed, you can quickly capture a highlight to Readwise by highlighting the desired text, selecting the share icon at the bottom of the tray on iPhone or top right on iPad (important: do not select Share in the popover), and selecting Save Highlight to Readwise. This highlight will then appear in the Articles section of your Readwise Dashboard.

## Web Clippers

You can use one of many "web clipper" apps such as [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) or [Worldbrain](https://getmemex.com/). These apps install an extension in your browser, enabling you to highlight things as you go. If you wish to use a web clipper, we recommend Hypothes.is because Readwise can directly integrate with the service and sync with no effort on your part. If you use Liner, you will need to periodically export your highlights to a CSV and then email those to [add@readwise.io](mailto:add@readwise.io).
