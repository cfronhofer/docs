# Can I sync a second Kindle account with Readwise?

Yes! You can sync a second Amazon Kindle account with Readwise. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Visit [read.amazon.com/notebook](http://read.amazon.com/notebook) and sign out of your first account using the link in the top right (where it says `Hello, [your name]`)
2. Sign in to your second Amazon account
3. Return to [readwise.io/sync](http://readwise.io/sync) and click the Amazon Kindle button

Going forward, whichever account is currently "logged in" at [read.amazon.com/notebook](http://read.amazon.com/notebook) will be kept in sync by the Readwise browser extension.
