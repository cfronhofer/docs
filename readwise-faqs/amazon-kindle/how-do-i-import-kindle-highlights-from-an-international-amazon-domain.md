# How do I import Kindle highlights from an international Amazon domain?

The Readwise extension is designed to work with Kindle highlights synced to the cloud at [read.amazon.com/notebook](http://read.amazon.com/notebook). Sometimes, international Kindle users will find their highlights stored on a domain other than the read.amazon.com. Many of these international domains will work fine with the Readwise extension as-is. Some will fail (such amazon.co.jp and amazon.cn).It's on our roadmap to add more robust international support, but in the meantime, there are a few workarounds, if you hit a snag:

1. Many of the international Amazon domains can be successfully synchronized using the [Readwise app](https://readwise.io/homescreen).&#x20;
2. If you read on a Kindle device (rather than the app), you can [upload a file](https://readwise.io/import\_clippings) called _My Clippings.txt_ that's stored on your Kindle.
3. Change the default language to English by clicking this [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/?language=en\_US) and then sync your Kindle account from [this link](http://readwise.io/welcome/sync?refresh=true).
