# Some of my Kindle books and highlights aren't syncing. What do I do?

Here are some troubleshooting steps to sync all your Amazon Kindle highlights with Readwise.

## Check that Amazon has all your highlights

Confirm that all the books you've read and highlighted on Kindle appear on this website: [read.amazon.com/notebook](http://read.amazon.com/notebook). The highlights on this page are the highlights that will automatically sync with Readwise using the Readwise browser extension.

If the books are not there, then it means they're not syncing with your Amazon account. This could happen for a few reasons:

1. You did not take any highlights in the book.
2. Your Kindle has been offline since you took the highlights. Make sure your device is connected to the internet so it can sync.
3. You might be highlighting books or documents you didn't purchase from Amazon. These highlights will not be synced with your Amazon account, and you need to import those to Readwise using a different method.

## Resync your account

If the books are showing up on [read.amazon.com/notebook](http://read.amazon.com/notebook) but still not syncing with Readwise, try forcing a full resync with Readwise using this link: [Full Resync](http://readwise.io/welcome/sync?refresh=true).

## Disable ad blockers

If the full resync doesn't work, try disabling any ad blockers for the Amazon and Readwise websites.
