# Can I jump to a highlight directly in the Kindle app?

Yes! If you're using Readwise on a desktop, you can jump directly to the highlight in the Kindle app for more context, provided you have the [Kindle app](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/fd/kcp) installed on your machine. All you need to do is click the downward chevron in the top right corner of each highlight and select **View in Kindle Desktop**, as shown below.

## Notes

* The newest Kindle app broke the location links, and not just for usâ€”the location links at [https://read.amazon.com/notebook](https://read.amazon.com/notebook) won't open in the new app either. If you download the [Kindle Classic App](https://apps.apple.com/mg/app/kindle-classic/id405399194?mt=12?mt=12), the location links should work again.
* This feature doesn't currently work on mobile because the Kindle mobile apps don't allow for "deeplinking" the same way the desktop app does.
* There is a limitation with the desktop Kindle app where you can only jump to a highlight's location if the Kindle app is closed. If the app is already open, you'll need to close it before trying to jump to a new location from Readwise.
