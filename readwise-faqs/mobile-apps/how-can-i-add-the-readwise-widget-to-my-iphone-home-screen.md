# How can I add the Readwise widget to my iPhone home screen?

To get started, you'll need to download the [Readwise iOS app](https://readwise.app.link/6VY4GcGnIgb). If you already have the Readwise app downloaded, you just need to make sure that it's updated beyond version 2.7.2.

## How do I add the widget to my home screen?

Long press anywhere on your unlocked iPhone screen, tap the `+` symbol in the upper right-hand corner, select Readwise, and tap Add Widget on the widget of your choosing.

## How does the widget work?

If you've already completed your Daily Review, the widget displays a random highlight that rotates every 5 minutes throughout the day. If you haven't yet finished your Daily Review, it shows the first review highlight alongside a helpful prompt.

## What do I do if the widget is blank or doesn't appear at all?

Make sure that your iOS is updated beyond version 14.5.1. Shutting down the phone for 10 seconds and then turning it back on can also help.
