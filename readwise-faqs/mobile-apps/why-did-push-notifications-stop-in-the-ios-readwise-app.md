# Why did push notifications stop in the iOS Readwise app?

Some users have reported that after getting a new iPhone or iPad and restoring a backup, they stop receiving push notifications from the iOS Readwise app. We're investigating the issue, but in the meantime, there is a fix:

* Rather than deleting the app from your Home Screen and then reinstalling, go to Settings → General → iPhone Storage → Readwise
* Once there, tap "Delete App" (as shown below)
* Once deleted, reinstall the Readwise app from the App Store
* After reinstalling, re-enable notifications

{% hint style="info" %}
You should receive push notifications from the Readwise app within one hour after the [send time of your Daily Review email](https://readwise.io/configure).
