# Can I turn off Daily Review emails and still get iOS notifications?

Yes! You can set your Email Frequency to "Never" on your [email preferences page](https://readwise.io/configure), and you'll still get your Daily Reviews in the app. You'll also continue to receive notifications as long as you've enabled push notifications for the Readwise app in your device settings.

The notification should arrive within an hour after the "email send time" set in your email preferences. So, for example, if you want the iOS notification at 10 AM, you can set the email time to 9 AM in your preferences.
