# How do I perform an action and then advance to the next document instead of returning to the list?

Sometimes when users perform an action on a document—such as Inboxing, Latering, or Archiving—it returns them to the document list rather than advancing to the next document.&#x20;

By default, if you move a document while in its reading view, you'll be returned to previous document list. You can toggle this behavior to instead auto-advance by looking for "Toggle auto-advance" in the Command Palette on web or switching the setting in the Settings panel on mobile.
