# How do I customize the sections in the left sidebar of the web app?

The sections in the left sidebar are just defaults and fully customizable, except for Home, Library, Feed, and Search (those are fixed). You can reorder the views by dragging and dropping, unpin the views from the sidebar by clicking the down caret at the top of the view, and pin new views from the [Manage views](https://read.readwise.io/views) page.
