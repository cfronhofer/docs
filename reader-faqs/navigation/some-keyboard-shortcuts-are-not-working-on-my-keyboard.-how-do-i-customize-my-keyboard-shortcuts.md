# Some keyboard shortcuts are not working on my keyboard. How do I customize my keyboard shortcuts?

Some non-North American keyboard layouts (such as German, Swedish, Dutch, Norwegian, Catalonian, etc.) may not be optimized for the default Reader shortcuts, such as `[` and `]` to open or hide the side panels. You can customize these shortcuts to your preference by navigating to `Account settings` > `Preferences` > [`[Customize]`](https://read.readwise.io/preferences/shortcuts).
