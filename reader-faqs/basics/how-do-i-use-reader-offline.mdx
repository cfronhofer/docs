title: 'How do I use Reader offline?'
---
Reader works offline on both web and mobile. On web, so long as you have [read.readwise.io](https://read.readwise.io/) open before you go offline, Reader will continue to work and any changes you make (e.g. new highlights) will sync once you come back online. Alternatively, you can install Reader as a Chrome web app or a wrapped Safari app that will both open and work offline.

On mobile, so long as you open the app before you go offline to make sure all your content is synced, Reader will work offline. (You might need to open articles, EPUBs, and PDFs to cache images.)
