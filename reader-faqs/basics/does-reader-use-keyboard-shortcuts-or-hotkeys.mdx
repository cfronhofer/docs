title: 'Does Reader use keyboard shortcuts or hotkeys?'
---
On web, Reader is fully keyboard shortcut driven, including while reading documents. Most shortcuts are shown in hover tooltips in the user interface, but you can additionally open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) or use the `?` shortcut to pull up a reference.

Note that if you use a Magic Keyboard with iPad, you should use the Reader web app in iOS Safari as we've not yet had an opportunity to optimize the iPad app with keyboard shortcuts yet. This is on the roadmap.
