title: 'How do I get started with Reader?'
---

Reader is a cross-platform reading application which includes a web app ([read.readwise.io](https://read.readwise.io/)), mobile apps for iOS and Android, and browser extensions for Chrome, Chromium-based browsers (Edge, Brave, Arc, etc.), Firefox, and Safari.

The best way to get started using Reader is to navigate to [read.readwise.io](https://read.readwise.io/) and read the _Getting Started with Reader_ article inserted into your Library by default. From there, we recommend you navigate to different sections of the app based on the type of content you read. For example, if you read PDFs, click on the PDF section and you'll see instructions in the right sidebar for how to upload those files.

(On mobile, you can find these sections by tapping the **Views** icon in the bottom navigation bar.)

Alternatively, you can also watch our community manager Erin's [short walkthrough video](https://readwise.io/reader101) to get up and running with Reader as quickly as possible:
