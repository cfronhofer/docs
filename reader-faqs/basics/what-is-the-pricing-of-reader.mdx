title: 'What is the pricing of Reader?'
---
Once Reader officially exits beta, we intend to reprice Readwise/Reader for new subscribers thereafter. Pricing is really hard and complex so we candidly haven't figured out the exact plans yet, but we hope to justify a slightly higher price point than Readwise could before Reader. Regardless, we don't intend to increase pricing on existing full subscribers at that time. This means that if you subscribe while Reader is in beta, you'll get lifetime access for $7.99/month (billed annually) as part of our current Readwise Full plan.
