# Can I change my custom Reader email address to make it easier to remember?

To customize your Reader email address, go to the [import options page](https://read.readwise.io/import) and click `Personalize email addresses` in the **Add to Library** section. Keep in mind that your chosen email must be unique to your account and that using a non-random string may increase the chance of your Reader email receiving spam.

**Note:** Any newsletters you subscribed to using your randomly assigned custom email will still appear in your account. However, if you personalize your email more than once, only your _current_ personalized email will work. Any personalized emails prior to your current one are effectively deleted and will no longer be able to receive mail.
