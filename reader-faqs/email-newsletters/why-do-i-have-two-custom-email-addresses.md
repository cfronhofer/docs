# Why do I have two custom email addresses?

Your Reader account has two custom emails: one to send things to your Library and one to send things to your Feed.

You can find both email addresses on your [import options page](https://read.readwise.io/import). Your library email will be under Add to Library and will end with `@library.readwise.io`, while your feed email will be under Add to Feed and will end with `@feed.readwise.io`.

We recommend using the library email address when sending one-off documents to your Reader account that you know you want to read, and to use the feed email when setting up auto-forwarding rules or subscribing directly to newsletters.
