# How do I find my custom Reader email address?

You can find your custom Reader email address in Reader a variety of places.

On web, if navigate to the default Email section, your address will be in the right sidebar if there's no content (if there is content, you can click into the `?` menu in the bottom right of the right sidebar and select `Show getting started tips`). The same is true if you navigate to the `Feed` section. You can also click the blue `+` button in the bottom left and select `More import options...` to navigate to the [import page](https://read.readwise.io/import) and see your custom email addresses.

On mobile, if you navigate to the `Settings` tab, you'll be able to find your custom email addresses listed.
