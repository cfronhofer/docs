# How do I customize the appearance of a PDF while reading?

Although customizing the actual PDF isn't possible within Reader, since PDFs are essentially just a series of images, you can switch the document to `Enhanced text mode` (via the `Text view` icon in the top left on web or `...` > `View as text` on mobile) to view a plain text version. While in this mode, you can use the same appearance customization available in any other document type via the `Aa` menu.
