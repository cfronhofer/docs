# How do I highlight across pages inside a PDF?

Without reflowing the PDF into plain text, there is no way to highlight across PDF pages in any app that we're aware of. That said, you can use Readwise's "[inline concatenation](https://blog.readwise.io/combine-highlights-on-the-fly/)" feature (see the Action Tags section above) to combine two disjointed highlights when they're imported into Readwise and before they're exported to your note-taking app.
