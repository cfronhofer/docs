# Sometimes PDFs have strange filenames. How do I change the name of a PDF?

Reader uses the metadata contained inside the PDF to determine its filename, which was often improperly set or not set at all by the PDF file creator. When this happens, the title of the PDF may be strange or confusing. With that in mind, you can edit this metadata by selecting Edit Metadata (`Shift + M`) in the bottom right of the `Info` sidebar. You can edit other document-level metadata than just title, and you can do this on documents other than just PDFs.
