# I'm using dark mode and the images in my PDF look strange. How can I fix it?

By default when using dark mode, PDFs have a color inversion filter applied to maintain the white-on-black color scheme. However, the filter can cause images to look pretty weird. If you'd prefer to turn it off, you can use the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) to search for `Disable/enable PDF color inverting`. On mobile, you can navigate to the Settings page and toggle off the `Enable PDF color inverting` setting.
