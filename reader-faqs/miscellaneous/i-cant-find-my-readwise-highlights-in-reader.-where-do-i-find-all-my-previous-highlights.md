# I can't find my Readwise highlights in Reader. Where do I find all my previous highlights?

Right now, you can think of Reader as another reading app that integrates with Readwise (albeit seamlessly). Every highlight you make in Reader instantly syncs with Readwise and then from Readwise to your note-taking apps. This integration, however, does not go the opposite direction. In other words, you won't find your Kindle highlights inside of Reader. Over time, we intend to create a unified experience within Reader.
