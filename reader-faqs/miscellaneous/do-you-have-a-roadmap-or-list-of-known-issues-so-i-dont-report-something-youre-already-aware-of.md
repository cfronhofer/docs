# Do you have a roadmap or list of known issues so I don't report something you're already aware of?

Our Reader beta newsletter is a great resource to get some insight into what we're working on (you can even [subscribe via RSS](https://readwise-community.ghost.io/2defd8e965b87487102ef0c6db1880/rss/) to get the updates directly in Reader!). Also feel free to reach out via the in-app feedback or email ([hello@readwise.io](mailto:hello@readwise.io)) to ask us any specific question. In general, we don't mind receiving duplicate feedback because it helps us prioritize.
