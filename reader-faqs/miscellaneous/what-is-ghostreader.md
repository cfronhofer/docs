# What is Ghostreader?

Ghostreader is Reader's implementation of GPT-3.5 to create a "Copilot of Reading". Ghostreader can operate at the word, sentence, paragraph, section, and document levels.

At the word level, Ghostreader can define words in context, supply encyclopedia entries, define a term in context of the author's usage, and translate. At the sentence and paragraph level, Ghostreader can simplify complex language, summarize long passages, and translate. It can even create haikus and emoji strings. To use Ghostreader at these levels, select text or use the focused paragraph and choose Invoke Ghostreader from the context menu or use the keyboard shortcut `G`. On mobile, tap the highlight, open the context menu (`...`), and select Invoke Ghostreader.

At the document level, Ghostreader can summarize documents, answer questions likely to be contained in the document, and more. To use Ghostreader at the document level, tap the more menu in the top right and select Invoke Ghostreader or use the keyboard shortcut `Shift + G`. On mobile, open the `...` menu in the bottom right and tap the `Ghostreader` icon. Note that answers to document-level questions will appear in the Document Note field at the top of the Notebook panel.

In addition to these built-in prompts, you can interface with GPT-3.5 directly using Ghostreader in tandem with Jinja templating and custom document variables.
