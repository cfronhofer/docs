# How do I create a query-based filtered view on mobile?

Creating filtered views on mobile is currently a bit clunky compared to the web interface, but it's still possible. To do so, tap into the `Views` tab of the app and then tap the `+` icon in the top right corner. This will ask you to enter a query for the new view.

Enter your query, then tap `Show`. From there you can tap `Save view` and give it a name, if you want to keep the search for future use.
