# What are Filtered Views?

The core organizational concept in Reader is what we call a Filtered View. A Filtered View is similar to a query-based search in Gmail like `title:Getting Started` or `author:Paul Graham`. Basically, you can think of your Reader account as one flat database of documents and Filtered Views enable you to "filter" those documents based on a variety of different parameters. Every time you click an author name or tag or RSS source in the Reader user interface to see all documents by that author or with that tag or from that RSS source, you are just creating a Filtered View on that parameter.

The best way to learn how to use Filtered Views is to watch our [Reader 202 walkthrough video on Filtered Views](https://readwise.io/reader202).

You can reference all the different parameters that can be used with Filtered Views (including examples) from this [Filtered View guide](https://www.notion.so/Reader-Filtering-Guide-d4b249df2eaa492283099ec2a3551640?pvs=21).
