# Can I use keyboard shortcuts to control TTS?

The web app has a full set of keyboard shortcuts to control TTS playback. `P` will play or pause, `shift + P` will stop playback, `left arrow` and `right arrow` will skip through the content, and `shift + up arrow` or `shift + down arrow` will control the volume. The built-in media controls on your keyboard will also work for this. To slow the speed of playback, press `,`, and to speed it up, press `.`.
