# How do I highlight while listening to a document using text-to-speech? Can I triple tap my AirPods?

Yes! To enable highlighting via triple tap, navigate to `Account settings` and then to `Headphone gestures`. By default, double tap is set to `Jump forward` and triple tap is set to `Jump backward`, but you can change either (or both) of these gestures to highlight instead.
