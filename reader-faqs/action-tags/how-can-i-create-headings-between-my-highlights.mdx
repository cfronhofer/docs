# How can I create headings between my highlights?

In Reader, headings are added to the Notebook view (`Shift + 1`) automatically when they’re detected within the document’s content. However, if you want to see those headings in Readwise as well, you’ll need to use an action tag. To do so, highlight the text that you want to appear as a heading, then add a note (`N`) with the text `.h1`. This will create a top-level heading with the text of the highlight. To create nested headings, you can use an `.h2` tag and so on.

Note that you can start with lower level headings (e.g. `.h3`) and they’ll still appear in Readwise, but for the table of contents to appear on the left side of the page, you’ll need to start with at least one `.h1` tag.
