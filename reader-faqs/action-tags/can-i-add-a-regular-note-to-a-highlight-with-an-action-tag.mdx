# Can I add a regular note to a highlight with an action tag?

Yes! To add a note to a highlight that has an action tag, simply add a line break after the action tag. You can do this by pressing `Shift + Enter` in the note field (`Enter` by itself will save the note). For example, if you wanted to add a brief description of a section’s content with a heading, you could do something like `.h1 ⏎ This section is about how Topic A relates to Topic X.` The note text will then appear below the heading in Readwise.
