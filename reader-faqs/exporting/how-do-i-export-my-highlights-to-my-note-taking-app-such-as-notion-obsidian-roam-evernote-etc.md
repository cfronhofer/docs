# How do I export my highlights to my note-taking app such as Notion, Obsidian, Roam, Evernote, etc?

Reader is innately connected to Readwise so every highlight you make in Reader will instantly sync with Readwise and then from Readwise to your note-taking apps. Over time, we intend to create a unified experience within Reader.
