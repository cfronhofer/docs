# How can I export the files I’ve uploaded to Reader?

You can download all the EPUB and PDF files you’ve uploaded by opening the Command Palette and searching for `Generate download` or by going to your [Account profile page](https://read.readwise.io/profile) and selecting `Export PDFs and EPUBs` in the **Export account data** section. Once Reader has generated the file, you’ll receive an email with the download link.
