# Can I export all the highlights from a document at once?

To copy or download all of a document’s highlights, go into the Notebook tab of the right sidebar and click `Export` at the very bottom.

* _Copy to clipboard:_ Copies all the notes and highlights as plain text for you to paste into any text editing app. (`Shift + Option + C`)
* _Download annotations:_ Downloads the document’s notes and highlights as a markdown file. (`Shift + Option + D`)
* _Edit export file:_ Opens the export template for the markdown template. This is editable and uses the Jinja2 templating language. (If you’ve ever customized an export from Readwise to a note-taking app like Obsidian or LogSeq, this should be familiar!)

For now, these export options are only available on web, but it’s on our roadmap to add similar options for mobile.
