# How do I save articles behind paywalls?

Articles from large news sites such as NYT, Washington Post, Medium, and so on often do not contain the full content due to the paywall on the website.&#x20;

If you save documents using the browser extensions on web or using the Safari browser and share sheet on iOS, paywalled documents should be saved without issue. Note that if you save directly from another app on iOS (e.g. NYTimes, Medium, etc.), this will result in partial parsing because Reader can only get the naked URL and those apps aggressively block read-it-later apps.

If you're seeing documents come over with partial content from a source in your Feed, you can quickly open the original article in your browser (by pressing `O` on your keyboard or tapping `...` > `Open` on mobile), make sure you're logged into the site in question (e.g. NYT, Medium, etc), and then re-save the page using the browser extension or mobile share sheet.
