# An article I saved includes non-core content such as an advertisement. How do I fix this?

We built a benchmark test we run against the top 200 articles saved to Readwise from Instapaper and Pocket and Reader already parses them better, but it's still not possible to parse the open web 100% correct 100% of the time.

If you save documents using the browser extensions on web or using the Safari browser and share sheet on iOS, these methods will generally result in the highest quality parsing because Reader is getting the full document content rather than the naked URL.

If the document still has extraneous content (such as inline advertisements), you should report those documents through the feedback section of the Reader app and selecting `Report document parsing issue`. We have an engineer dedicated to fixing parsing tickets and we are constantly upgrading our parsing.
