You can toggle this feature on or off from the Appearance panel by tapping into the `Aa` icon in the top right corner and selecting the `Paged scroll` option.

To change the default behavior of this feature, you can tap into the `More style options` menu and toggle "Paged scrolling by default" on or off for each document type.

By default, EPUBs will have this option turned on, but you can adjust to suit your own preferences and the settings will be saved for any document you open on the same device.
