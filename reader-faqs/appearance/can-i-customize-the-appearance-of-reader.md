# Can I customize the appearance of Reader?

You can customize the text formatting on both web and mobile. Click or tap the `Aa` icon (top left on web, top right on mobile) to access a variety of settings:

* _Typeface:_ Select from a variety of serif and sans serif typefaces, including Atkinson Hyperlegible and OpenDyslexic.
* _Font size:_ The default is 20px, but this is adjustable down to 14px and up to 80px. (`Shift + -` to decrease, `Shift + =` to increase.)
* _Line spacing:_ Change this to adjust the amount of blank space between each line of text. Defaults to 1.4. (`Shift + :` to decrease, `Shift + "` to increase.)
* _Line width:_ Adjusts the maximum width of the document content. Defaults to medium. (Web only. `Shift + ,` to decrease, `Shift + .` to increase.)
