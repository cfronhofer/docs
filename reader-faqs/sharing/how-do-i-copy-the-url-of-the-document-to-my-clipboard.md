# How do I copy the URL of the document to my clipboard?

You can copy the URL of the document to your clipboard in a variety of different ways. On web, you can simply hit `Shift + C` to copy the URL of the current document or focused document to your clipboard. Alternatively, you can hit `O` to open the original document in a new tab or hover over the domain underneath the document title in the right sidebar to reveal a copy button. On mobile, you can enter the more menu (`...`) on any document and choose `Share` to copy the URL.
