# How do I print an annotated copy of a document?

You can print a clean copy of the document with all of your highlights and notes by pressing `Cmd/Ctrl + P` or by opening the `...` menu and selecting `Print with annotations`. You can then use your browser's print dialogue to select a printer, customize the print options, and print the document.
