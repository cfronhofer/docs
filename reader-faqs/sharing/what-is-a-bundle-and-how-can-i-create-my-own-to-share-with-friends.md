# What is a Bundle and how can I create my own to share with friends?

Bundles are themed collections of documents with pretty landing pages that can easily be shared with others.

To create a bundle, first save a filtered view in the web app, click the down chevron next to its name, and select `Enable public link`. You can optionally add a description and a cover image to spice up the public landing page. When a recipient hits the `Open in Reader` call-to-action, a filtered view will be created in their account and populated with the documents you curated.
