# How do I share highlights?

You can share a beautified image of any highlight by clicking the `...` icon while hovering the highlight in the Notebook panel, then selecting `Share highlight as image`.

On mobile, you can do this by tapping the `i` icon in the top right, tapping into the Notebook tab, tapping the `...` beside a highlight, and selecting `Share as image`.
