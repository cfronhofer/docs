# How do I use a keyboard shortcut to save documents to Reader using the browser extension?

By default, you should be able to tap `Alt + R` to save a document to Reader using the browser extension. If you're using Chrome or a Chromium-based browser, you can edit this shortcut for the browser extension here: chrome://extensions/shortcuts.
