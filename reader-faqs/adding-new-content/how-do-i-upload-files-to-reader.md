# How do I upload files to Reader?

You can upload a variety of different file types to Reader, including PDFs, EPUBs, and OPML files. To upload a file, drag it on top of the web app, or open the Upload dialog (keyboard shortcut: `U`) and select the file.

On mobile, use the "share" action from within your device's Files app and find the option in the share sheet labeled "Upload \[file] to Reader".
