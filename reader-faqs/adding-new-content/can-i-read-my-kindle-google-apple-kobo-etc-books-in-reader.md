# Can I read my Kindle/Google/Apple/Kobo/etc books in Reader?

If you purchased a book on a different platform that doesn't provide an option to download a DRM-free EPUB file, you won't be able to import that book to Reader. Those other platforms intend for the books they sell to be read within their own ecosystem (e.g. Amazon wants you to read on a Kindle or in their app), so they don't provide a way for the books to be exported to third-party services like Reader.

For books that are in the public domain, you can find many places online to download EPUB versions. We like [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) for their dedication to quality proofreading and modern formatting.
