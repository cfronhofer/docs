# How do I watch a YouTube video inside Reader?

If you save a YouTube link to Reader, you'll be able to watch it alongside its time-synced transcript and take notes and highlights as it plays. On web, you can also precisely navigate the video by clicking any fragment, clicking a highlight in the right sidebar, or using special keyboard controls.

**Note:** Unless the creator of the video uploaded a custom transcript, Reader uses the one auto-generated by YouTube. This can result in some inaccuracies. The best course of action is to alert the creator to the discrepancies and see if they can take action to fix them.
