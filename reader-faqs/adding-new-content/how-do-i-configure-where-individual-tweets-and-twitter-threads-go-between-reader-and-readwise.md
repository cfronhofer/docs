# How do I configure where individual tweets and Twitter threads go between Reader and Readwise?

Users have many different preferences on where they want to save individual tweets and threads. By default, we make the assumption that individual tweets are like highlights and therefore go into Readwise, whereas Twitter threads are like articles and therefore go into Reader. If you want to change any of this, you can customize the Twitter behavior on the [Integrations page](https://read.readwise.io/integrations).
