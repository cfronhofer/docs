# How do I group or organize RSS feeds into folders?

You organize all content in Reader (including RSS feeds) using a concept called Filtered Views. Filtered Views are extremely powerful, enabling you to create all kinds of dynamic subsets of your documents, but you can quickly add RSS feeds to groups on the [Manage feeds](https://read.readwise.io/feed/sources) section within Feed.
