# How do I mark items as seen simply while scrolling my Feed?

Right now, Reader doesn't have a way to automatically mark items as seen as you scroll your Feed list like other RSS apps you may have used in the past. That said, there is a special Feed UI on mobile that will display documents as cards that will be marked as seen as you scroll through them. You can access this option by tapping the icon that looks like a stack of cards with a star in front of it.

In addition, you can customize your swipes on mobile to include an action that marks all items above as seen so you can scroll and then, once done, mark all items you've scrolled past with a single action.
