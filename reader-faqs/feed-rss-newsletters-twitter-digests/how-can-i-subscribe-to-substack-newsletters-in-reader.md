# How can I subscribe to Substack newsletters in Reader?

If the newsletter is free, you can subscribe via the RSS feed. The easiest way is to save any article from the Substack feed youâ€™d like to subscribe to, then use the `Subscribe` button in the Info panel to add the feed.

For newsletters with paid content, the RSS feed will only display the first paragraph or two. To get the full content, you can open the original article by pressing `O` on your keyboard. You can then save the page using the browser extension, which will bring the full content into your Reader Library.

Alternatively, you can set up a forwarding rule to forward the paid newsletters from your email to Reader by using [your custom email address](https://read.readwise.io/import).
