# My RSS feed is adding incomplete articles to Reader. How do I get the full content?

Some RSS feed creators include partial rather than full content in their RSS feed (e.g. just a summary or first paragraph rather than the whole article). If you notice this, you can "Report partial feed content" by pulling open the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) and searching for this option. This will cause Reader to forcefully parse the URL of the RSS entry going forward rather than relying on the feed author to include the proper content.

This can also help when the articles are missing metadata, such as the author's name or a thumbnail image.
