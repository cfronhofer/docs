# What is the "1" badge on my app icon?

The Reader badge on iOS appears when you haven't viewed your Daily Digest for the day. Once you've viewed the Digest, the icon badge should disappear. Since it only represents the current day's Digest, it will never be a number larger than one.

If you'd like to keep the Daily Digest as an option in the app but you don't want to see the badge, you can disable badge notifications for Reader in the system settings of your device.
