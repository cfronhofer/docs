# Where can I find the Daily Digest?

On mobile, you can find the Daily Digest at the top of your `Home` section. Currently the web version of the app doesn't have the same scrollable format for reviewing your Daily Digest, but you can add a section to your `Home` screen by clicking into the `Configure` dropdown in the top right corner and selecting "Today's Daily Digest." This will display all the same documents that you would see when scrolling through the Digest on your mobile device.
