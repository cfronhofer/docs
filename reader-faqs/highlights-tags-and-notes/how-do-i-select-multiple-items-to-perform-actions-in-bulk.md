# How do I select multiple items to perform actions in bulk?

Currently, Reader does not have a multiselect option enabling you to manually select more than one document in a particular list view. That said, Reader does have a Bulk Action (`Shift + B`) option enabling you to perform actions on every document in the list in one fell swoop. Combined with filtering (`Shift + F`, described above), you can often achieve the desired outcome of multiselection with Bulk Actions.
