# Why aren't highlights I took using the browser extension appearing in the Reader app?

Any highlight you make on the native web using the browser extension will _typically_ sync with Reader (and from Reader to Readwise) and vice versa. That said, there are some exceptions when the position of highlight made in one platform cannot be matched with sufficient confidence in the other platform. In these rare cases, the app will notify you that it failed to match and those highlights will still be visible in the Notebook tab of the Reader web app.
