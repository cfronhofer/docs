# How do I quickly pull up all articles with a particular document tag?

You can quickly pull up all documents with a particular document a couple different ways. First, you can always tap a document tag wherever it's shown in the user interface to navigate to a filtered view of that document tag. Second, you can go to the `Manage tags` page from the `Library` on web or you can click on `Views` on mobile and choose `Tags`. Finally, you can create a filtered view by tapping `Shift + F` on web and entering `tag:[tag-name]` (replace `[tag-name]` with the exact name of your tag).
