# How do I copy text or highlights to the clipboard?

You can copy a highlight's text to your clipboard by selecting the highlight, tapping the "more menu" icon (`...`), and selecting `Copy text`. If you have autohighlighting disabled, you can also copy selected text to the clipboard this way. If you have autohighlighting enabled, you can hold down `Alt` (on Windows) or `Option` (on Mac) to temporarily disable autohighlighting and select text. Finally, you can quickly use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl + C` on web to copy the focused paragraph or focused to clipboard.
