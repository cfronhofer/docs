# What’s the difference between document tags and highlight tags?

Document tags are applied to the entire document by pressing `T` while in list view or `Shift + T` in document view. These tags are used to organize content within Reader, pull documents into filtered views, and identify topics at a glance from list view.

Highlight tags are applied directly to highlights by pressing `T` while a highlight is selected in document view. These tags aren’t currently searchable within Reader, but they sync to Readwise with the highlight.

In Reader, you can find a the list of tags of all the tags you’ve used on the [Manage Tags](https://read.readwise.io/tags) page, which can be accessed from top of the Library \*\*view or via the `Manage tags` option in the sidebar on web. On mobile, you can find your tags via Views > Tags.
