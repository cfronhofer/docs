# What is auto-highlighting?

Auto-highlighting is a feature that converts any selected text into a highlight immediately. It's a great way to spare yourself an extra click every time you want to make a highlight, and to better simulate the experience of highlighting analog documents with a marker or pen.

That said, if you often select text with the purpose of copying it or just generally prefer to select text first and then decide if you want to save it as a highlight, you can disable auto-highlighting. On web, you can press `Shift + H` on your keyboard or use the Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) to search for `Toggle auto-highlighting`. On mobile, tap into the `...` menu in the bottom right turn off the `Toggle autohighlighting` option.
