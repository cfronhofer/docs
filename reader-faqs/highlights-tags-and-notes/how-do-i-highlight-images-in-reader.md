# How do I highlight images in Reader?

Reader enables you to highlight images while reading. These images will carry over into Readwise and even into your note-taking app if you export your highlights. To highlight images, simply focus the image and use the keyboard shortcut `H` or select it with the mouse (plus any desired text) on web, or select it plus any desired text on mobile.
