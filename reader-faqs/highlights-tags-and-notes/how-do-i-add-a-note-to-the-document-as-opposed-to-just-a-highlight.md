# How do I add a note to the document as opposed to just a highlight?

On web, you can add a document note by opening the Notebook tab in the right sidebar (or using the keyboard shortcut `Shift + N`). On mobile, tap the `i` button in the top right and then tap into the Notebook tab.

Document notes don't appear with your highlights in Readwise 1.0 yet, but you can still export them to any note-taking app that allows you to customize the export template (e.g. Obsidian, Roam, etc).
