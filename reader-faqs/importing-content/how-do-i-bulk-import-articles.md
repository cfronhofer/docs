# How do I bulk import articles?

To bulk import documents to Reader, youâ€™ll need to have a CSV file containing all of the URLs you want to add. To ensure they import correctly, the CSV should have a column titled "URL" (or "Url" or "url") that contains all of the links. Optionally, you can also include a "Title" column that contains the title of each document.

Upload the CSV file by going to the [import page](https://read.readwise.io/import) and using the `Upload file` option, pressing `U` on your keyboard, or dragging and dropping the file from your computer onto the Reader window.
