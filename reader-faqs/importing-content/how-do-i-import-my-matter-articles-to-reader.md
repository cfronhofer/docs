# How do I import my Matter articles to Reader?

You can import your Matter articles to Reader by generating an export inside the Matter app, which will send you an email with a link to download your data, and forwarding this email to [read@readwise.io](mailto:read@readwise.io). Reader will automatically follow the link and import your previously saved documents.
